FIX THIS

I’d like to thank my wife Cara for her tireless support and for offering an objective opinion whenever the need arose. I appreciate it hugely, though it might not always show. When I ran out of energy (often!), Cara was on hand to help me put together a much-needed task list and without her constant encouragement this book would never have been finished.

Ross and Caitlín, my son and daughter, are always on hand to offer a down to earth opinion, for which I’m always thankful, they tell it like it is. As a father they make me immensely proud.

Amanda Gross , my editor, keeps me on my toes. He’s not afraid to challenge my thinking, encourage me to clarify the narrative, and sharpen up my writing, and for that I’m eternally grateful.

Over almost a decade, my Masters students have provided constant inspiration. They indulge me in long tutorials – essentially conversations – that wander the avenues of potential. Many a day and night has been spent with these students exploring the realms of the possi-

82 ble, and I’m extremely grateful to them for the latitude they’ve granted me. The discussions I’ve had with them have shaped this book and will, I’m sure, shape my other – future – books.

Paddy Donnelly, one of my Masters graduates, provided the initial inspiration to get Tiny Books ready for lift off. I very much appreciate his encouragement. Sarah Richards and Cat Noone graciously gave me their time and their feedback on my early drafts. Vic Bell very kindly designed the Tiny Books brand, which gives everything direction. Lastly, Kai Brach – Offscreen magazine’s publisher – generously offered to write a foreword, for which I’m extremely grateful.

Finally, I’d like to thank Chris Shiflett and Cameron Koczon, the dynamic duo behind Brooklyn Beta. I had the pleasure and privilege of attending the full five years of Brooklyn Beta, a wonderful conference that truly inspired me. All shared one common theme, encouraging attendees to ‘Make something you love.’

In that simple and focused mission lies an inescapable truth: that the things you make, whether they are analogue or digital, should be things you love. Focus on that and the rest – I believe – falls into place. Messrs Shiflett and Koczon threw down a gauntlet at my first Brooklyn Beta: to do something. This book – an attempt to share what I’ve learned with others following in our footsteps, and hopefully empowering them – is my small something.

I appreciate their challenge and hope they’re happy with the result.
