Summary
-------

**In this chapter I'll focus designing interfaces in a desktop context. These might be native app, web app or websites. I'll explore how desktop interfaces differ from mobile interfaces and explore how mouse interfaces can be more granular.**



Overview
--------

Overview goes here…



Section 1: A Different Interaction Paradigm
-------------------------------------------

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


Designing for desktop contexts is fundamentally different to designing for the considerably more constrained space of mobile interfaces. When designing interfaces for desktop contexts we need to adopt a different approach, tailored to the medium.

Whilst a great deal of time may have elapsed since the first GUIs were designed in the late 60s and early 70s, desktop interfaces at their core have remained remarkably similar.

As Craig Hockenberry, at [Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com) – a company that has been reimagining computer desktops since 1996 – puts it:

> [A great deal has] changed radically over the past 35 years, but it’s important to note what hasn’t changed during that same period of time. You still use a bitmap display for output with a keyboard and mouse for input.
> 
> The interaction model has changed, but only slightly. There are enhancements and refinements, like trackpads and gestures, but a Mac is completely usable using nothing but the basic concepts that were laid down by the original team.

Whilst Hockenberry is exploring Apple's macOS environment specifically, the underlying fact remains that the interaction paradigms in a desktop context have remained largely similar.

When we design desktop interfaces our users are primarily interacting with our interfaces using:

+ a mouse, which allows for more granular control; and
+ a keyboard, which allow for shortcuts to be used.

In addition to the use of a mouse and a keyboard users now – albeit in a limited manner – are beginning to have access to voice controls, using Siri on macOS, for example. All of that said, the fact remains, when we design desktop interfaces we can draw on tried and tested heuristics that have stood the test of time.


### White Space


There's more space in a desktop context, but that doesn't mean we should fill every ounce of space. A subsection on white space would be useful. I often see students filling space with content and with additional UI elements, e.g. navigation or other components and modules.

White space helps the user, it draws the eye to the content that matters. In addition to the need for hierarchy that I explored in Chapter 3, desktop contexts 

How a user reaches a button, for example, with a mouse… This is different in a desktop context. Tap targets can be smaller (button sizes, etc.) because users are employing a mouse, which is considerably more granular.

Similarly, users have a keyboard at their disposal and we can provide supplementary controls through the use of keyboard shortcuts.



Section 2: Heuristics? Fitt's Law? Psychology?
----------------------------------------------

All of the above could go here, but there might be too much in this scratch list. I'll return to this shortly, when I've mapped everything out on Post-Its.



Section 3: A Hierarchy of Needs
-------------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


This title needs to be reworked (and it might change), but I need to cover somewhere – in a way that doesn't overlap too heavily with the IA chapter – the idea that a desktop interface needs a clear hierarchy…

Think about what's presented up-front at the top of the page. Look at 'the inverted pyramid' from the world of journalism.

As we progress further down a page we get into detail. What's at the top, however, needs to tick the boxes that the user needs ticked.

Mention Maslow, it might also be worth mentioning Aarron Walter's thoughts on Maslow as reworked for the web.



Section 4: The Importance of Clear Calls to Action
--------------------------------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


Calls to Action (CTAs) definitely need to be considered somewhere in the book and I think this, or the preceding – mobile – chapter, would be a good place to cover them.

Talk about **a hierarchy of intent**. When a user looks at an interface they need to know what's the most important call to action.

As applications become more complex, this need to be teased out. Designing pages that have **too many CTAs** lead to confusion and inaction. Users can become paralysed by choice.



Section 5: Anatomy of a CTA
---------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


There's a great Medium article that Lee Munroe linked to a few years ago that undertakes an exhaustive analysis of CTA buttons.

This could be reworked for 2019, but a great deal of it still stands. A CTA button might appear to be a simple component, but in reality it's much, much more complex. When designing a CTA button, you need to consider:

+ The form of the button (size, shape, color…);
+ The content of the button (words); and
+ What feedback is presented when a user clicks the button.

Unpacking this we see that something as simple as a button is actually a complicated design challenge.



Further Reading
---------------

There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help further underpin your understanding of designing user interfaces for a desktop context. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.

+ Item 1

+ Andy Clarke's [Art Direction for the Web](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/art-direction-for-the-web) is a lovely book. The books is published in both ebook and hardback book formats… I'd recommend going the extra mile and ordering the hardback. It's beautifully designed and – as a book (in addition to the excellent content) – is a lovely object.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
