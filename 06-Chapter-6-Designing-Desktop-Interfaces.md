Chapter 6: Designing Desktop Interfaces
=======================================

<!-- XXXX Words -->

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**



Table of Contents
-----------------

/* This is very rough and needs a day to tidy it all up. (In fact, it's threadbare, but I still think a chapter on designing desktop interfaces is worth including.) I'll Post-It out this chapter and the preceding chapter when I get to Donegal. */

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
