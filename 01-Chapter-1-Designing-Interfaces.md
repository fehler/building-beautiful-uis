**In this chapter I’ll explore how we arrived at where we are today. I’ll provide a brief history of user interface design – drawing from principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) – before detailing a number of current user interface design systems, including: Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines; Google’s Material Design and IBM’s Living Language.**

Designing Human Interfaces
--------------------------

<!--

Designing Human Interfaces

We explain what user interfaces are so that we’re all on the same page. Then we introduce the idea that the term human interface is – in my opinion – better that user interface.

We’re dealing with humans – the term ‘users’ is too abstract – and we need to never lose sight of the fact that humans are messy. A human might be using your interface whilst doing other human things: feeding a baby, cooking the dinner, watching TV, so it’s important we build in affordances we design our interfaces.

-->

STRESS UP FRONT:

	U → H

WE'RE DESIGNING FOR HUMANS, AND HUMANS ARE MESSY…

Firstly, let’s not lose sight of the fact that we’re designing for users, the ‘U’ in ‘UI’. Users have needs and – if we are to serve them well – we need to design our interfaces to accommodate those needs.

When we design user interfaces we need to focus on first principles:

Get out of the way;
Aim for maximum functionality; and
Help your users.

I’ve merged what was two separate sections here. Essentially we’re saying that ‘users’ are actually ‘humans’ and humans are messy. The word ‘user’ is – in my opinion – a little too abstract.

Humans are trying to achieve tasks – perhaps to book a flight, or to buy a book – while juggling other human tasks, for example, feeding a baby.

Understanding this is critical. The best user interfaces get out of the way and help you to get things done with the minimum of fuss.

/* Show a screenshot here, perhaps MailChimp’s UI. */

A user wants to send an email to their mailing list, we need to enable them to achieve that task while – as much as possible – getting out of the way.

The context is rapidly changing. We need to consider…

+ Desktop (Mouse)
+ Tablet → Smartphone (Finger)
+ Wrist (Finger)

We also need to consider conversational interfaces, both text-driven and voice-driven. Both of these contexts are seeing slowly emerging UI patterns.



A Little History
----------------

<!--

A Little History

We provide a little context. As per my comment above. You asked: “Do we want to go this far back.” My answer would be a resounding: “Yes!”

There is a great deal – desktops and metaphors – that was imagined up in the 80s that’s every bit as relevant today. Many self-taught designers don’t know this history or these principles an I believe our role is to uncover this for them.

-->

AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PAST WILL HELP YOU TO DESIGN USER INTERFACES THAT ARE INFORMED BY DECADES OF UNDERSTANDING…

STRESS THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF…

There is a great deal that was designed from the 60s-80s – for example the concept of desktops and metaphors – that’s every bit as relevant today.

Understanding the history of visual interfaces and how they have evolved will serve you well in the here and now.

Xerox Star (1981)
Lisa (1983) and The Macintosh (1984)
The Here and Now

Covering this history allows us to introduce key thinkers – for example, Don Norman – who still have a great deal to offer.

Don’t worry, we’re not going to get too lost in this, but I do think it’s important. Plus we can design nice images – documents, folders, etc. – that illustrate what we’re talking about.



Desktops and Metaphors
----------------------

<!--

Desktops and Metaphors

With the history – which will be light touch – under our belt we start to explain the idea of metaphors. People expect a ‘shopping cart’ icon, for example, to look like a shopping cart. They expect a ‘document’ or ‘folder’ icon to look like a document or a folder.

Users have a mental model of the world and – as designers – we should stick, where possible, with that mental model.

-->

With the history under our belt – which sets the scene – in this section we explain clearly what we mean by metaphors. How we can use metaphors to make complex concepts understandable.

In this section we hammer home the idea of ‘mental models’ and explain that users have an understanding of certain concepts that designers then use in interfaces as a kind of ‘shorthand’ for navigation.

For example, we might introduce:

a ‘cog’ icon that users understand means ‘settings’;
an ‘envelope’ icon that users understand means ‘email’; or
a ‘folder’ icon that users understand means a place to organise files.

We explain that designers have co-opted real world objects to ‘stand for’ digital objects. When we click on a cog, we know that software that we’re about to adjust the settings for isn’t made up of actual cogs, this is just an idea.

There is lots we can draw from here.



Establishing Clear Mental Models
--------------------------------

Whatever the interfaces we design, it’s highly likely that **our users will have experienced other interfaces that will have established a ‘mental model’ in their mind of how things work**. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:

> What users believe they know about a user interface strongly impacts how they use it. […] Mental models are one of the most important concepts in human-computer interaction.

Users have mental models based upon their past experiences and it’s important that we take these mental models on board when considering our information architecture. **A mental model is what the user believes about the system they are using.** Put simply:

1. Mental models are based upon beliefs, not facts: that is they are mental models of what users know – or think they know – about the interface that you’re designing.

2. Individual users have different mental models based upon their own unique past experiences.

One of the biggest problems we run into when designing user interfaces is **the conflict between what we – as the designers of the interface – know about the underlying system and how it works, and how users expect things to work**.

When considering your information architecture, it helps to consider how your interface relates to others’ interfaces. In short: **Users expect sites and applications to act and work alike.** Introducing new models can lead to confusion on the part of the user, resulting in an interface that doesn’t work.

Regardless of what we’re designing, we can embrace fundamental principles of design to ensure that our interfaces benefit from a clear visual hierarchy, ensuring complex information is easy to understand and navigate through.

<!-- We can also rely on tried and tested metaphors that users understand… instead of inventing new approaches. For example: A shopping cart is universally understood, so consider mental models and metaphors that echo what users have experienced elsewhere. -->



UI, Here and Now
----------------

<!--

A Three Decade Journey (Renamed to 'Here and Now')

Here we show a clear line for interfaces of the 80s to the interfaces of today. We show Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and Google’s Material Design language.

We could contrast a System 7 window (with folders and icons) and show how – other than styling, which has evolved – a macOS Mojave window (with folders and icons) looks, in principle, the same.

-->

Content here… This is Apple's HIG, Material Design, etc..

I think the fact that Apple provides human interface guidelines – and not user interface guidelines – is an important distinction and it’s one we should tease out. We’re seeing a return to terms like human-centred design (as opposed to UX design) and I think Adobe should lead the way here in reigniting these ‘old’ principles.

Apple is treading a bit of a tightrope, clearly they don’t want to lose sight of their heritage (and their first set of groundbreaking Human Interface Guidelines), but – as you’ll see in the copy on their page – they use both terms human interface and user interface.

**Caption: Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines provide in-depth information and resources for designing interfaces that work on Apple’s various operating systems (macOS, iOs and watchOS).**

As Apple note in their iOS guidelines, their approach is underpinned by three guiding principles:

Clarity
Deference
Depth

We could dive a little deeper (but not too much) into these principles. There’s background on these principles in Apple’s Design Themes.

I’ll also talk about other systems like Google’s Material Design system and IBM’s Living Language, so that we don’t get lost drinking just Apple’s Kool-Aid. (See below, which I’ll write up shortly.)

At the end of this section I'm going to add an overview of:

Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines
Google’s Material Design
IBM’s Living Language

These provide a useful overview of designing interfaces at a high level before we get into analysing how interfaces are built for the next module.

**Caption: Google’s Material Design guidelines provide in-depth information and resources for designing interfaces that work.**

Developed in 2014, Google’s Material Design expanding on the ‘card’ motifs that debuted in Google Now. Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

PICTURE

**Caption: IBM’s Living Language is described as, “A shared vocabulary for design.” It represents IBM’s move into a design-driven culture and is well worth exploring.**

As IBM put it in their Living Language: “Focus on users’ goals. Design tools that lead people to actionable insights. Be proactive, always anticipating users’ next moves and helping them prepare for change.”

IBM’s Living Language – designed to be a shared vocabulary for design – represents IBM’s move into a design-driven culture and is well worth exploring. Currently on v2, IBM are also maintaining an archive of past versions, which offer a great deal of practical advice for designing user interfaces.

PICTURE

**Caption: styleguides.io is also worth bookmarking for a useful overview of how other companies – at a wide range of scales – are handling user interface design.**

Lastly, styleguides.io is a very useful roundup of other approaches to developing user interface libraries and style guides. It’s worth bookmarking and offers an insight into how a wide range of companies are moving towards the development of visually consistent user interface libraries.
