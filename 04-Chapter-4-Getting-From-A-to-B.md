Chapter 4: Getting From A → B
=============================

**SCRATCH**

This chapter is all about the flows through interfaces. We need to stress that flows happen at two levels:

1. page to page; and
2. within screens.

The second point is important to stress. Increasingly pages are comprised of multiple **states** that we need to consider. I should show an example of this, where we're not moving to a separate screen per se, but we are moving to a different **parts of an interface**.

The 'add a calendar event' shot (Yellow Plus Button – REDRAW THIS) is a nice example. The user is interacting with the page and the page is responding to their actions. This needs to be considered also, as much as a page to page interaction.

This chapter also needs content on:

+ User Stories and Customer Journey Mapping

Both of these probably need their own sections as they are different, albeit related.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
