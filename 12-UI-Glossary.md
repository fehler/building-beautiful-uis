Chapter 10: UI Glossary
=======================

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished – in fact this glossary isn’t even started – but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**



This is the glossary that will accompany the book. This is an initial scratch file gathering terms I’ll be defining, I’ll be adding draft content shortly.



## 5 Second Test

This is a gut reaction test designed to capture first impressions. (As I’ve noted above, this isn’t the finished text, it will be richer!)

## A/B Test

An A/B Test is designed to test two variants of a similar design to see which is more effective.

## Accessibility

Here I should stress the importance of ensuring user interfaces are accessible. This might be achieved in a variety of ways (but starts – on the web – with a solid foundation of semantic markup). It’s important to consider the colors you use, ensuring there is enough contrast between text and the background color.

XD-Specific Terms
=================

I think we should separate these from the rest of the entries, but I do think we should include them. Auto Animate, Repeat Grid, etc., are all worth defining.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.

You might like to [follow me](https://www.twitter.com/fehler) on Twitter for updates on this book, that book and other projects I’m working on.
