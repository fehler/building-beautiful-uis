Building Beautiful UIs Task List
================================

This task list provides an overview of the progress I've made so far. I started it on Sunday, 14 April so I could begin building towards a deadline of late May. (If the content's finished by late May we need to discuss how we're building it… i.e. who is building the website.)

The UI Glossary is structured with all the terms we need to define, but I haven't started it yet. I'll do it last, that way we can add new terms we may have missed as I find them while writing.
