Overlays and Scrims
-------------------

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


This feels a little weak if it’s just overlays and scrims, perhaps widen the scope of this section to stress the need to legibility and accessibility. Also consider usability: An interface needs to be legible if it's to work and overlays and scrims are useful for this, especially image-heavy intertaces.


**An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.**

Somewhere, probably in the swipe files, I need to explain overlays and scrims. Reword the following:

> An alpha colored layer to increase contrast between your background image and content.

Combine and reword the following:

> A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it’s also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

> A scrim is a piece of translucent fabric, usually held together on some sort of frame, that defuses the light hitting your subject.

An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.

Show light and dark overlays (look at my Photos, there’s good illustrations from the above article).

Show top and bottom scrims. As above, there are screenshots in the article.
