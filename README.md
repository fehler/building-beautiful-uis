Building Beautiful UIs
======================

I’ve now moved this repository so I don’t have multiple copies of the book flying around and causing confusion. The new repository is available [here](https://github.com/buildingbeautifuluis/bbuis).

My studiomates at [Little Thunder](https://littlethunder.co) have designed a temporary website for the ‘in progress’ version of the book so that [you can read it as I write it](https://buildingbeautifuluis.github.io). I’m delighted with the new website. As usual, the Little Thunder team have knocked it out of the park. If you’re looking for partners on a digital product, I’d recommend them in a heartbeat.

You might like to [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fehler) for updates on this book and other projects I’m working on.
