Building Beautiful UIs
======================

I’m super excited to finally share an initial draft of ‘Building Beautiful UIs’. I’ve been working on this ‘course in a book’ for a few months now. What started life as a book, has now expanded to include a wealth of additional extras that we’ll be giving away for free.

I’ve road-tested everything on my second year Interaction Design students at Belfast School of Art, so everything is well and truly fit for purpose. (I’d like to thank my second year students – a talented cohort – for all of their feedback and help.)

We’re hoping to publish ‘Building Beautiful UIs’ in May or June. Watch this space for details or [follow me](https://www.twitter.com/fehler) on Twitter.



Overview
--------

This isn’t just a book, it’s a course in book that is accompanied by a wealth of digital extras. We’ve included: 30+ XD files; 5 printable cheat sheets; and a series of templates you can use freely. You can see the Chapter 2 XD artboards here:

The content is structured as follows:

+ Chapter 1: Designing Interfaces
+ Chapter 2: The Building Blocks of Interfaces
+ Chapter 3: Information Architecture
+ Chapter 4: Getting From A → B
+ Chapter 5: Designing Mobile Interfaces
+ Chapter 6: Designing Desktop Interfaces
+ Chapter 7: Animating Interfaces
+ Chapter 8: Project X-Rays
+ Chapter 9: Where to from here for UI?

In addition to the content above, I’m working on a UI Glossary, designed to unravel the wealth of terms you might encounter as a user interface designer. This is currently a work in progress, but it will be published in its finished form when the book launches.



Swipe Files and Templates
-------------------------

As noted above, I’ve provided a wealth of files for you to refer to. Everything’s built using Adobe XD and is open source. You can use everything in the course as a starting point for your own projects.

If you find the content useful, please spread the word. My goal is to help as many people as possible and if you know of someone who’s an aspiring UI designer, please share the link to this GitHub repo. The more the merrier.



XD How To…
----------

Adobe XD is made for designers by designers. It’s the fastest way to design, prototype and share any user experience, from websites and mobile apps to voice interactions and more. Even better, it’s free.

To explore the book’s accompanying digital files, [download a copy of XD](https://xd.adobe.com). (Did I mention it’s free?)



Open Sans
---------

I’ve created all of the XD example files using Open Sans. As its name suggests, it’s an open source that you can [download for free](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans). This will allow you to open all of the files without experiencing missing font issues.

A humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Fonts, Open Sans was commissioned by Google. Designed and created in 2010, it was released in 2011.

As of July, 2018 Open Sans is the second most served font on Google Fonts, with over four billion views per day on more than 20 million websites. In short: It’s a tried and tested workhorse of a typeface.

I chose it because it comes in five weights with accompanying italics so it’s a versatile typeface.

Open Sans can also be activated via [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/open-sans).

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
