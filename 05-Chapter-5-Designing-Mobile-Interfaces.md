Summary
-------

**In this chapter, I’ll focus on designing for mobile environments. I’ll stress the benefits of a ‘mobile-first’ approach and introduce the idea of tap targets and reachability.**



Overview
--------

This chapter should stress the importance of a 'mobile-first' approach and highlight the benefits that this brings. Largely this is about focusing the interface down to the core elements and building from that.

Users are busy, so focus is essential. Your task as a designer is to enable users to get the job done as quickly as possible, ideally:

1. Minimising interruption; and
2. Maximising delight.

Delight isn't just about beautiful interactions (animations, for example), it's also about enabling users to get what they need to get done as quickly as possible.

We can learn a lot from content-first sites like GOV.UK, where a considerable amount of time is invested in distilling down complex information so that it's easy to parse and act upon.

A section needs to be dedicated to tap targets and reachability, which in a mobile context are of primary importance.

Further Reading
---------------

There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help further underpin your understanding of designing user interfaces for a mobile context. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.

+ Luke Wroblewski’s [Mobile First](https://amzn.to/2IK0PcF) – published in 2011 – is rightfully regarded as the book that encouraged designers to adopt a mobile first approach to designing for the web. It might be almost a decade old, but it’s still well worth reading for its focus on the benefits that a mobile first approach offers.

Nick Babich’s [A Comprehensive Guide To Mobile App Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-guide-to-mobile-app-design/) – sponsored by Adobe and published by the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – complements this chapter perfectly. Babich provides a thoroughly in-depth view of the challenges faced when designing for a mobile context and I’d strongly recommend reading his article, once you’ve completed this chapter.

+ Lastly, Giles Colborne’s [Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design](https://amzn.to/2XPSn1P) – though not exclusively about designing mobile interfaces – is an excellent book that explores the user experience benefits of embracing simplicity and focusing on usability. It’s a short, sharp read that’s packed with useful advice.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
