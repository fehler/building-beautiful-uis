Overview
--------

This chapter should stress the importance of a 'mobile-first' approach and highlight the benefits that this brings. Largely this is about focusing the interface down to the core elements and building from that.

Users are busy, so focus is essential. Your task as a designer is to enable users to get the job done as quickly as possible, ideally:

1. Minimising interruption; and
2. Maximising delight.

Delight isn't just about beautiful interactions (animations, for example), it's also about enabling users to get what they need to get done as quickly as possible.

We can learn a lot from content-first sites like GOV.UK, where a considerable amount of time is invested in distilling down complex information so that it's easy to parse and act upon.

A section needs to be dedicated to tap targets and reachability, which in a mobile context are of primary importance.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
