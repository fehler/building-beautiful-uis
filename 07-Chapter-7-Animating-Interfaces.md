Chapter 7: Animating Interfaces
===============================

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**



Chapter Table of Contents
-------------------------

+ Part 1: Animation Communicates Intent
+ Part 2: Analysis of an Interaction (Trigger, etc.)
+ Part 3: Lessons From Disney
+ Part 4: Macro-Interactions (Page-Level)
+ Part 5: Micro-Interactions (Element– and Component-Level)



Summary
-------

**We're kicking off this section by explaining the benefits of animation as part of a user interface designer's skillset.**

Stress the important role that animation plays in delight. Also stress that we – as UI designers – aren't creating static pages, we're creating rich, interactive pages and animation helps with this.



Overview

Overview goes here…



Part 1: Animation Communicates Intent
-------------------------------------

Part 1 goes here…

[UI Animation and Microinteractions](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/animation/)

The above feels like it needs to be in the first section, contextualising everything. Think of a better part five, because this doesn't feel right as is.



Part 2: Analysis of an Interaction (Trigger, etc.)
--------------------------------------------------

Part 2 goes here…



Part 3: Lessons From Disney
---------------------------

This is about learning from Disney, etc.. Mapping over lessons.

Easing in and out, squash and stretch, etc..



Part 4: Macro-Interactions (Page-Level)
---------------------------------------

I have lots of examples of this.

When talking about the page-level, talk about page-to-page and states **within** pages. Both offer an opportunity to use well-considered animation to enhance the user's experience.



Part 5: Micro-Interactions (Element– and Component-Level)
---------------------------------------------------------

Build this out…

[Micro-Interactions: Why, When and How to Use Them to Improve the User Experience](https://uxdesign.cc/micro-interactions-why-when-and-how-to-use-them-to-boost-the-ux-17094b3baaa0)

The above is useful…



Further Reading
---------------

+ Val Head's resources, for sure, should be included here. Also point people towards her newsletter.

+ Val's book, perhaps? Or roll that in to the preceding recommendation.

+ Donovan's CSS Animation? It doesn't feel right to me as it's very CSS-focused and I think this chapter needs to deal with principles, first and foremost.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
