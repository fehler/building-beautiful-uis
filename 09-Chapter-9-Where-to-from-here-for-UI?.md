Chapter 9: Where to from here for UI?
=====================================

<!-- 1,503 Words -->

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

/*

Look at my messages to Neil Cybart. There's thinking in those tweets that is relevant here. I could also copy and paste some of it, e.g. where I refer to AR and future products like AR Apple Glasses, etc.. Think about Hololens, too, it's not all Apple.

Also, think about what's wrong with 'Her'. For one, if everyone's talking to an interface there will be problems. We're already running into some of those problems now with the emergence of smart speakers…

Accidentally triggering a voice assistant, Alexa, Siri…

Uttering a phrase like, "Hey Google!" might trigger in everyday conversation. This is already happening, as noted above. We'll need to start to consider ways around this.

All of that said, as we move into an era defined by wearables – AirPods, etc. – we need to consider how we interact with these kinds of devices when there's no visual interface, as such.

Summary
-------

**In the final chapter, I’ll provide some pointers outlining where user interface design is heading. I’ll look at conversational and voice interfaces and explore the world of augmented reality, providing you with a sense of where UI’s headed in the future.**



Overview
--------

/* When I explore conversational UIs, stress that a voice UI is a (for the most part) a conversational UI, but a conversational UI might not necessarily be driven by voice. It could be driven via SMS or other text messaging platforms. Don't conflate the two. */

In this chapter I should emphasise that Adobe XD can be used for conversational <!-- Voice? Check. --> prototyping and has powerful tools that allow you to build non-visual UIs quickly.

**This is an important point to stress. There are a few articles from the Adobe Blog that I could point readers towards.**

It would be nice to build an example of a conversational UI to include in the book's supporting material.

Next point, see above… Don't repeat myself.

Just because a UI is conversational (whether that's verbal, or a more 'text-like' interface) doesn't mean everything we've covered is irrelevant. We'll need to, for example, consider how a user gets from A to B and that's every bit as important in a conversational UI.

Stress the need for flow diagrams when designing for conversational interfaces. These can be created in XD, of course.



Section 1: Where next for UI?
-----------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


This section's all about the exciting developments that lie ahead of us. Conversational interfaces are – to a high degree – 'dissolving' what have been until very recently, largely visual interfaces.

The opportunity ahead is exciting and Adobe XD is well-placed to drive these opportunities through its voice prototyping capabilities.

<!--

Where’s interface design heading?

Closing out the module, we explore where interface design is heading. I’d suggest we mention conversational UIs and the rise of augmented reality (AR) being driven by companies like Apple.

When we mention conversational UIs, we should stress that language is important. As noted designer, John Maeda, puts it: “Writing Is Design’s ‘Unicorn Skill’.”

When we mention AR we should stress that layering UIs on top of the world – where we see the interface and the world, together – is one of design’s next challenges.

-->

In this section I'll paint a broad brushstrokes picture of where UI design is heading, with an emphasis on conversational UIs, voice interfaces, AR and VR.



Section 2: Conversational User Interfaces
-----------------------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


Look at my responses to Neil Cybart on Twitter (14 May) and stress that 'voice interfaces' and 'conversational interfaces' are often used interchangeably and they are not the same thing. Expand on this and hammer home the difference…

Also talk about the emergence of chatbots and how these might be used to lighten the load on visual interfaces. For example, if I'm using a help system, I might answer some questions – using a conversation UI – and then be channeled to a specific visual UI.

I just discovered this patent filing by Google that's worth reading:

https://patents.google.com/patent/US20100205180A1/en

Look at images 1, 3 and 5.

Image 5 especially:

> "I want to change my password."

The abstract is confusing:

> Linguistic analysis is used to identify queries that use different natural language formations to request similar information. Common intent categories are identified for the queries requesting similar information. Intent responses can then be provided that are associated with the identified intent categories. An intent management tool can be used for identifying new intent categories, identifying obsolete intent categories, or refining existing intent categories.

Simplify this. There's good content here, it's just written in patent language.

The emphasis here is on conversational UIs, with a focus on text-driven interfaces. I'll stress the importance of flows, as covered in Chapter 4, and their role in underpinning how a conversational interface is organised.

Show the lovely (Dan Zomboni?) portfolio site that's conversationally-driven. Break it apart and explain how it's working.

Also, bring in XD. There's a lot of interesting work being done here.



Section 3: Voice Interfaces
---------------------------

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


The emphasis in this section is on voice interfaces, with an emphasis on devices like Amazon's Echo, Google's Home and Apple's Homepod and underlying Siri technology.

The focus is on voice-driven interfaces. Whilst voice interfaces clearly depend upon spoken word interactions, there remains a need to consider how a voice interface presents text interactions on a screen.

PICTURE: Show Siri's interactions on a phone, for example how an animated status indicator communicates that the device is 'listening'.

Talk about AirPods and, "Hello, Siri." Explain how this changes things because there's no longer a visual interface per se, but we still need to consider the user's needs and how we communicate in a world of voice-first prototyping.



Section 4: An Augmented Future
------------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


This section's all about the rise of Augmented Reality (AR) and the opportunities that it offers. The section should also touch on – and distinguish between – AR and VR experiences.

Apple is leading the way here with its ARKit tools. Similarly, Microsoft's Hololens product is providing a glimpse of what's possible in an augmented future.

There's clearly a lot of exciting opportunities ahead and it's never been a more exciting – if somewhat nerve-wracking! – time to be a UI designer.



Section 5: Heads Up Displays
----------------------------

![Placeholder Image](images/section-opening-placeholder-image.png)

**CAPTION: Caption here.**


This might be rolled into the preceding section. Above all, the point I'm making is that Heads Up Displays (HUDs) are transforming the interaction paradigms of computing.

HUDs have been around for a while – talk about fighter pilots, for example – and we can learn from the lessons of the past. Clearly there are opportunities ahead where the 'screen' that we're interacting with (and designing for) isn't necessarily a 'traditional' screen: a desktop-, mobile- or wrist-based screen.

Car windscreens are increasingly being co-opted as areas rich in real estate that could be repurposed. Companies like Tesla are re-imagining what a dashboard might look like.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
