Chapter 9: Where to from here for UI?
=====================================

**SCRATCH**

Here I should reiterate that Adobe XD can be used for voice prototyping and has been built with this in mind. This is an important point to stress. There are a few articles from the Adobe Blog that I could point readers towards.

Just because a UI is conversational (whether that's verbal, or a more 'text-like' interface) doesn't mean everything we've covered is irrelevant. We'll need to, for example, consider how a user gets from A to B and that's every bit as important in a conversational UI.

Stress the need for flow diagrams when designing for conversational interfaces. These can be created in XD, of course.

Part 1: Where next for UI?
------------------

<!--

Where’s interface design heading?

Closing out the module, we explore where interface design is heading. I’d suggest we mention conversational UIs and the rise of augmented reality (AR) being driven by companies like Apple.

When we mention conversational UIs, we should stress that language is important. As noted designer, John Maeda, puts it: “Writing Is Design’s ‘Unicorn Skill’.”

When we mention AR we should stress that layering UIs on top of the world – where we see the interface and the world, together – is one of design’s next challenges.

In this section I'll paint a broad brushstrokes picture of where UI design is heading, with an emphasis on conversational UIs, voice interfaces, AR and VR.



Part 2: Conversational UIs
--------------------------

The emphasis here is on conversational UIs, with a focus on text-driven interfaces. I'll stress the importance of flows, as covered in Chapter 4, and their role in underpinning how a conversational interface is organised.



Part 3: Voice Interfaces
------------------------

The emphasis in this section is on voice interfaces, with an emphasis on devices like Amazon's Echo, Google's Home and Apple's Homepod and underlying Siri technology.

The focus is on voice-driven interfaces. Whilst voice interfaces clearly depend upon spoken word interactions, there remains a need to consider how a voice interface presents text interactions on a screen.

PICTURE: Show Siri's interactions on a phone, for example how an animated status indicator communicates that the device is 'listening'.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
