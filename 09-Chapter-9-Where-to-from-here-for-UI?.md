Chapter 9: Where to from here for UI?
=====================================

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

Overview
--------

Here I should reiterate that Adobe XD can be used for voice prototyping and has been built with this in mind. This is an important point to stress. There are a few articles from the Adobe Blog that I could point readers towards.

Just because a UI is conversational (whether that's verbal, or a more 'text-like' interface) doesn't mean everything we've covered is irrelevant. We'll need to, for example, consider how a user gets from A to B and that's every bit as important in a conversational UI.

Stress the need for flow diagrams when designing for conversational interfaces. These can be created in XD, of course.



Part 1: Where next for UI?
--------------------------

This section's all about the exciting developments that lie ahead of us. Conversational interfaces are – to a high degree – 'dissolving' what have been until very recently, largely visual interfaces.

The opportunity ahead is exciting and Adobe XD is well-placed to drive these opportunities through its voice prototyping capabilities.

Where’s interface design heading?

Closing out the module, we explore where interface design is heading. I’d suggest we mention conversational UIs and the rise of augmented reality (AR) being driven by companies like Apple.

When we mention conversational UIs, we should stress that language is important. As noted designer, John Maeda, puts it: “Writing Is Design’s ‘Unicorn Skill’.”

When we mention AR we should stress that layering UIs on top of the world – where we see the interface and the world, together – is one of design’s next challenges.

-->

In this section I'll paint a broad brushstrokes picture of where UI design is heading, with an emphasis on conversational UIs, voice interfaces, AR and VR.



Part 2: Conversational User Interfaces
--------------------------------------

The emphasis here is on conversational UIs, with a focus on text-driven interfaces. I'll stress the importance of flows, as covered in Chapter 4, and their role in underpinning how a conversational interface is organised.

Show the lovely (Dan Zomboni?) portfolio site that's conversationally-driven. Break it apart and explain how it's working.



Part 3: Voice Interfaces
------------------------

The emphasis in this section is on voice interfaces, with an emphasis on devices like Amazon's Echo, Google's Home and Apple's Homepod and underlying Siri technology.

The focus is on voice-driven interfaces. Whilst voice interfaces clearly depend upon spoken word interactions, there remains a need to consider how a voice interface presents text interactions on a screen.

PICTURE: Show Siri's interactions on a phone, for example how an animated status indicator communicates that the device is 'listening'.

Talk about AirPods and, "Hello, Siri." Explain how this changes things because there's no longer a visual interface per se, but we still need to consider the user's needs and how we communicate in a world of voice-first prototyping.



Part 4: An Augmented Future
---------------------------

This section's all about the rise of Augmented Reality (AR) and the opportunities that it offers. The section should also touch on – and distinguish between – AR and VR experiences.

Apple is leading the way here with its ARKit tools. Similarly, Microsoft's Hololens product is providing a glimpse of what's possible in an augmented future.



Part 5: Heads Up Displays
-------------------------

This might be rolled into the preceding section. Above all, the point I'm making is that Heads Up Displays (HUDs) are transforming the interaction paradigms of computing.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
