Chapter 2: The Building Blocks of Interfaces
============================================

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

Overview goes here…



Part 1: The Basic Building Blocks (Point, Line, Plane)
------------------------------------------------------

This is the fundamentals. It's stressing a need to learn about graphic design principles. At heart our user interfaces are informed by an understanding of graphic design.



Part 2: Typography
------------------

Stress that this isn't a typography course – that could be a standalone course in and of itself – but I am trying to introduce fundamental principles that you'll find useful when you consider the design of a range of elements.

Stress that all interfaces will feature language somewhere. In addition to developing an understanding of language, it's important to develop an awareness of fundamental typographic principles.



Part 3: Objects  → Elements
---------------------------

This section is the heart of everything, it's about how elements – the fundamental units from which we build interfaces – are created.

The emphasis on this chapter is that everything we encounter in a user interface – an element, a component or a page – is comprised of other, simpler elements.

Understanding how the basic building blocks of interfaces work – as a simple, element level – helps us to develop a language of elements that we can build into complex interfaces.



Part 4: A Library of Elements
-----------------------------

This isn't an exhaustive list, but it does provide an overview of some typical elements you'll need to consider.

Somewhere I need to explain what the different elements are. There’s lots of useful information here, especially as regards naming elements:

I'm going to introduce ~5 and then link to the usability.gov page for a more comprehensive overview.


### Buttons

Buttons indicate an action on click or touch and are typically labelled with text, an icon or both.


### Toggles

Toggles allow users to change settings between two states, for example: on and off. Ensuring the on and off states are visually distinct improves toggles usability.


### Tags

Useful in lots of contexts, for example in profile components or on content-driven pages.


### Progress Bars

Progress bars communicate what stage a user is as at as they progress through a series of tasks. They can also be used to indicate other types of information, for example the progress of a download.


### Tool Tips

Providing user feedback is essential and tool tips are a helpful way to do this, providing users with guidance where it's needed.



Part 5: Overlays and Scrims
---------------------------

This feels a little weak if it's just overlays and scrims, perhaps widen the scope of this section to stress the need to legibility and accessibility.

**An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.**

Somewhere, probably in the swipe files, I need to explain overlays and scrims. Reword the following:

> An alpha colored layer to increase contrast between your background image and content.

Combine and reword the following:

> A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it's also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

> A scrim is a piece of translucent fabric, usually held together on some sort of frame, that defuses the light hitting your subject.

An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.

Show light and dark overlays (look at my Photos, there’s good illustrations from the above article).

Show top and bottom scrims. As above, there are screenshots in the article.

Three art boards:

Scrims (top, bottom)

Further Reading
---------------

+ Christian Leborg's 'Visual Grammar' helps to explain the fundamental principles of visual grammar. It's an excellent book that focuses on the foundations – point, line and plane – from which all interfaces are built.

+ Matej Latin's typography book. An excellent guide to typography on the web (and also applicable beyond the web, to mobile and other contexts). Latin also has a free, six-part (?) email course that is well worth signing up for.

+ 'Universal Principles of Design' is an excellent book… (I've enough in Chapter 3 to use this here.)

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
