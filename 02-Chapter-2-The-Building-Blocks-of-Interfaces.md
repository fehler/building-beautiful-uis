I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.

You might like to [follow me](https://www.twitter.com/fehler) on Twitter for updates on this book, that book and other projects I’m working on.

**Scratch Content**

**Roll all of this into the chapter, then delete this scratch content.**

The emphasis on this chapter is that everything we encounter in a user interface – an element, a component or a page – is comprised of other, simpler elements.

Understanding how the basic building blocks of interfaces work – as a simple, atomic level – helps us to develop a language of elements that we can build into complex interfaces.

Somewhere I need to explain what the different components are. There’s lots of useful information here, especially as regards naming elements:

I'm going to introduce ~5 and then link to the usability.gov page for a more comprehensive overview.


### Buttons

Buttons indicate an action on click or touch and are typically labelled with text, an icon or both.


### Toggles

Toggles allow users to change settings between two states, for example: on and off. Ensuring the on and off states are visually distinct improves toggles usability.


### Tags

XXXX


### Progress Bars

Progress bars communicate what stage a user is as at as they progress through a series of tasks. They can also be used to indicate other types of information, for example the progress of a download.


### Tool Tips




Overlays and Scrims
-------------------

**An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.**


Somewhere, probably in the swipe files, I need to explain overlays and scrims. Reword the following:

> An alpha colored layer to increase contrast between your background image and content.

Combine and reword the following:

> A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it's also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

> A scrim is a piece of translucent fabric, usually held together on some sort of frame, that defuses the light hitting your subject.

An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.

Show light and dark overlays (look at my Photos, there’s good illustrations from the above article).

Show top and bottom scrims. As above, there are screenshots in the article.
