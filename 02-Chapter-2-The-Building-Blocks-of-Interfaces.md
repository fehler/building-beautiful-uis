Chapter 2: The Building Blocks of Interfaces
============================================

**SCRATCH**

The emphasis on this chapter is that everything we encounter in a user interface – an element, a component or a page – is comprised of other, simpler elements.

Understanding how the basic building blocks of interfaces work – as a simple, atomic level – helps us to develop a language of elements that we can build into complex interfaces.

Somewhere I need to explain what the different components are. There’s lots of useful information here, especially as regards naming elements:

I'm going to introduce ~5 and then link to the usability.gov page for a more comprehensive overview.


### Buttons

Buttons indicate an action on click or touch and are typically labelled with text, an icon or both.


### Toggles

Toggles allow users to change settings between two states, for example: on and off. Ensuring the on and off states are visually distinct improves toggles usability.


### Tags

XXXX


### Progress Bars

Progress bars communicate what stage a user is as at as they progress through a series of tasks. They can also be used to indicate other types of information, for example the progress of a download.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
