Chapter 2: The Building Blocks of Interfaces
============================================

**As I’ve noted in the [overview](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/00-Overview.md), this is a work in progress and I’m sharing it here in draft form. It isn’t finished, but I hope it provides some value as I finalise all of the chapter content.**

Summary
-------

In this module **I’ll introduce the fundamental building blocks that interfaces are made from**: point, line, plane; iconography; typography; tone and color. **I’ll break apart a series of interfaces** – which I’ll also provide as swipe files for reference – **and I’ll analyse how they are constructed from simple building blocks**.

I’ve created a series of PDF scratch files and Adobe XD artboards to accompany this chapter. These walk through the process for more visual learners and can be used in conjunction with the book.

Overview
--------

Overview goes here…

This is the fundamentals. It’s stressing a need to learn about graphic design principles. At heart our user interfaces are informed by an understanding of graphic design.

In this chapter I’ll explore how different elements and components are created from objects. These relatively simple objects:

+ Points
+ Lines
+ Planes

In addition to these building blocks we also use typography to ensure the interfaces we design are legible and readable.

Part 1: Interfaces Are Like LEGO
--------------------------------

![LEGO](images/ch2/LEGO.png)

CAPTION: With a mountain of LEGO bricks, we can build virtually anything. We’re limited only by our imagination. User interfaces are the same: Once we’ve created some basic elements – buttons, toggles and tags, for example – we can build any UI we desire.

<small>I wonder if each part should have an opening image? That way, in a single image, I can encapsulate what the part is about.</small>

When you’re starting on your journey as a UI designer it can be intimidating trying to work out how different interfaces are built.

Take any interface, however, and you’ll see that even the most complicated of interfaces is built up of simpler elements and components. By starting with these elements and components you can quickly develop an understanding of how UIs are constructed.

Working with my students at Belfast School of Art, I encourage them to take existing interfaces and break them apart into their constituent parts. By using a [‘Master-Apprentice‘](https://github.com/fehler/building-beautiful-uis/blob/master/10-Appendix-1-Master-Apprentice-Exercises.md) approach – analysing others' interfaces and rebuilding them – you not only learn about how interfaces are constructed, but you also begin to understand the principles that lie behind good interfaces.


### The Master-Apprentice Model

The Master-Apprentice model stretches back to the days of painters like [Rembrandt](https://oldmasters.academy/old-masters-academy-art-lessons/who-were-rembrandts-teachers-and-students) and I believe it's worth revisiting. By focusing on rebuilding others' interfaces to start with, you learn to 'train your eye'. This approach also helps you to develop the techniques you need to master before putting them into practice in your own creative work.

In the 17th century, apprentices's education was undertaken for a minimum of 2-3 years, and – at times – for as many as 7 years. A two year apprenticeship was considered to be the minimum, with guild rules specifying that an apprentice couldn’t leave their master before the term ended. An apprenticeship was an investment, with a total cost of 600-700 guilders, which could buy a small house at that time.

The good news is that – in our connected world underpinned by the web – you can embark upon a 'virtual apprenticeship' at relatively little cost. All you need is time and a willingness to work hard and learn. [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=UI) is a good place to start. Search for UI, choose something you like and rebuild it.

**CAPTION: Dan Gold, a second year student on my Interaction Design programme at Belfast School of Art, created the above Master-Apprentice exercise. On the left is the original, by Nadia Ivanova, on the right is Dan's exercise.**

To help you on your journey I’ve provided a series of ‘Master-Apprentice’ examples in addition to the example above, so you can see how these exercises work. I’ve provided examples of desktop, mobile (smartphone, tablet) and wrist UIs so you can begin to develop an understanding across a range of contexts. I created these myself so that I could develop my skills. I might be fast approaching 50 years old, but I’m still learning.


### LEGO FTW!

One of the reasons that LEGO is such a much-loved product is the fact that from a series of individual blocks you can make almost anything you put your mind to.

Just like LEGO blocks can be built and combined, so, too, interfaces are created from relatively simple elements.


This section should maybe not reference the Objects → Elements → Etc. or it'll get too long. Leave that for the next section?

Talk about LEGO and use the metaphor to explain the idea of building complicated things out of simple things.

Explain how everything is broken down…

+ Objects
+ Elements
+ Components
+ Pages
+ Flows

I'LL BE FOCUSING IN THIS CHAPTER ON THE FIRST TWO…




Part 2: Objects → Elements → Components → Pages → Flows
-------------------------------------------------------

![Objects → Elements → Components → Pages → Flows](images/ch2/objects-elements.png)

CAPTION: Everything we build is created from relatively simple objects. By combining these objects in different ways we can create different user interface elements, which can then be combined to create components that are then organised on pages. Link these pages together and we have the flows that underpin everything we build.

/* I wonder if each part should have an opening image? That way, in a single image, I can encapsulate what the part is about. */

Everything we create is built from smaller parts. At the simplest level, a user interface is comprised of the following:

+ Objects
+ Elements
+ Components
+ Pages
+ Flows

In this chapter, I'll be focus on elements, demonstrating how they can be built from simple objects. In the next chapter, I'll show how these elements can be combined to create components and pages, which form the backbone of user interfaces.

This approach – Objects → Elements → Components → Pages → Flows – is similar to Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](#) methodology. I never studied chemistry, so I find Frost's naming convention (which features 'atoms' and 'molecules'




IMG: A simple button.

CAPTION: A simple button, like the one above, is comprised of a series of essential objects. In this case: a rectangle with rounded corners, some typography and an arrow (which itself is created from a circle and two lines).

Taking a button as an example, we can see that it’s created from a series of relatively simple objects. Don’t repeat myself too much (!).








Part 3: Objects  → Elements
---------------------------

This section is the heart of everything, it’s about how elements – the fundamental units from which we build interfaces – are created.

The emphasis on this chapter is that everything we encounter in a user interface – an element, a component or a page – is comprised of other, simpler elements.

Understanding how the basic building blocks of interfaces work – as a simple, element level – helps us to develop a language of elements that we can build into complex interfaces.








Part 4: A Library of Elements
-----------------------------

This isn’t an exhaustive list, but it does provide an overview of some typical elements you’ll need to consider.

Somewhere I need to explain what the different elements are. There’s lots of useful information here, especially as regards naming elements:

http://bit.ly/namingelements

I’m going to introduce ~5 and then link to the usability.gov page for a more comprehensive overview.


### Buttons

Buttons indicate an action on click or touch and are typically labelled with text, an icon or both.


### Toggles

Toggles allow users to change settings between two states, for example: on and off. Ensuring the on and off states are visually distinct improves toggles usability.


### Tags

Useful in lots of contexts, for example in profile components or on content-driven pages.


### Progress Bars

Progress bars communicate what stage a user is as at as they progress through a series of tasks. They can also be used to indicate other types of information, for example the progress of a download.


### Tool Tips

Providing user feedback is essential and tool tips are a helpful way to do this, providing users with guidance where it’s needed.



Part 5: Overlays and Scrims
---------------------------

This feels a little weak if it’s just overlays and scrims, perhaps widen the scope of this section to stress the need to legibility and accessibility.

**An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.**

Somewhere, probably in the swipe files, I need to explain overlays and scrims. Reword the following:

> An alpha colored layer to increase contrast between your background image and content.

http://thetheme.io/thesaas/uikit/overlay.html

Combine and reword the following:

> A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it’s also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

> A scrim is a piece of translucent fabric, usually held together on some sort of frame, that defuses the light hitting your subject.

An overlay covers the entire image in a consistent tone, a scrim is a gradient.

Show light and dark overlays (look at my Photos, there’s good illustrations from the above article).

Show top and bottom scrims. As above, there are screenshots in the article.

Three art boards:

Overlays (black, white)
Overlays (color)
Scrims (top, bottom)

25, 50, 75%



Further Reading
---------------

+ Christian Leborg’s ‘Visual Grammar’ helps to explain the fundamental principles of visual grammar. It’s an excellent book that focuses on the foundations – point, line and plane – from which all interfaces are built.

+ Matej Latin’s typography book. An excellent guide to typography on the web (and also applicable beyond the web, to mobile and other contexts). Latin also has a free, six-part (?) email course that is well worth signing up for.

+ ‘Universal Principles of Design’ is an excellent book… (I’ve enough in Chapter 3 to use this here.)
