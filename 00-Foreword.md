Foreword
========

<!-- 133 Words -->

I have in mind a few people, but we’ll need to see of they’re acceptable to the Adobe XD team.

Top of my list would be Tim Van Damme. Tim is currently Principal Designer at Abstract. He previously worked at Gowalla, Instagram, Dropbox and Mailbox. He’s incredibly talented designer and I think he’d be perfect.
