Chapter 8: Project X-Rays
=========================

**SCRATCH**

I'm thinking of focusing the Project X-Rays down to three people (Vic Bell, Howard Pinsky and Val Head) so that we can get the book finished – and published – more quickly.

Everything's taking a long time to complete and I think we could add a couple more X-Rays once it's published. The beauty of a digital publication is we can update it. I have others I've spoken to who are keen to be included, if there's time we can build them in.


Summary
-------

In this chapter I've interviewed a cross-section of industry professionals who are all working in user interface design.

Bonus Content

I think the bonus content will be Master-Apprentice exercises where I get permission from each of the people we interview to show an example of their work, deconstruct it and then rebuild it in XD.

I've run this past the interviewees.



Further Reading
---------------

I don't know if there's further reading for this chapter. It seems redundant with the interviews where we'll link to each of our case studies.

I hope you find this resource useful. I’m also currently working on a book for the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. It will be published in late 2019.
